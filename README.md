# FlexBox Dashboard
![A screenshot of the site](screenshot.png)

## Overview
This project was made as an inspiration form the <strong>Odin Project's Admin Dashboard Project</strong>. The actual project required the use of <strong>CSS Grid</strong> but I haven't learnt that yet so I used <strong>CSS FlexBox</strong>

## What I used
* HTML - For Page Structure
* CSS - For Page Styling
* CSS FlexBox - For Page Layout
* JavaScript - For minor functionalities within the page

## Images
All the images I used was downloaded for free at <strong><em>undraw.co</em></strong>
